# comite_24-25
A super-secret website for Comité 24-25.

Members (comitards) of MDS 2024–2025 have a QR code printed on the back of their polo, linking directly to their personal secret profile page.

Built for fun, designed for efficiency — and surprisingly addictive.

# Requirement
python >= 3.10

Flask (pip install Flask)

# Setup
```console
git clone https://github.com/riri-314/comite_24-25.git
cd comite_24-25
python3 app.py
```
The addresse of the local server should be printed in the terminal.

# PythonAnywhere setup
Work exactly like in local. 

To update a file (e.g. app.py). Go to the "files" tab, locate "app.py" upload the new app.py file. Go to the "web" tab, click on reload website. Done


# Files
1. app.py, the main python file with the flask server
2. people.py, contain the data of the people
3. templates/index.html is the html of the home
4. templates/people.html is the html template for a person
5. templates/404.html is the not found page
6. static/ contain all of the pictures and favicons

# Best practices
Pictures should not be larger than 100kB.

No more than 10 pictures by person.

Do not enter the person name in people.py if some pictures are too "guindaille". It prevent google from indexing.
